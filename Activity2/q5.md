i.
All Approaches' Output: 0 : 2 : 4 : 6 : 8 : %
Let's break down each Approach
#1
_ The for loop on the main function is calling until 5, as we can see in the doubleL function, that is the end to reach the list and it will append 5 numbers
_ First, we initialized the res list as an array[]
\_ In the for loop, until the array each 5 numbers, each number next will multiply by 2
\_ And it will return the new list
Ex:
i = 0, append 0 - 2 = 0
i = 1, append 1 - 2 = 2
...
i = 4, append 4 \* 2 = 8
\_ Then each number will seperate by : character, this line prints the current value of i, followed by a colon and space (: ), all on the same line due to end=' : '.

#2
\_ It is the same of Approach 1 but it is the short version of 1

#3
\_ This is another version of Approach 1, the main difference is the yield i \* 2, yield is used to product a series of values, each time the iteration, it yields the next doubled value

ii.
\_ That is a generator function, it is a special type of function that uses the 'yield' keyword to produce a sequence of the values easily (one at the time), it allows you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, making it a faster, cleaner and easier way to create an iterator.

#Apporach 1:
Regular Function
Advantage: Readability and Easier Debugging -> Simple, straight forward and easy to understand.

#Apporach 2:
Not a function, this is a List Comprehension
Advantage: Conciseness -> Expressive, allows the user to achieve the same result in a shorter form and easily for readability with the syntax

#Approach 3:
Generator Function
Advantage: Lazy Evaluation -> Produces values one at a time as needed, memory efficient. Represent infinite sequences, which is not possible with a list-based approach.
